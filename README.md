# HIPPOCAMPAL VOLUMETRIC QUANTIFICATION OF ALZHEIMER'S PROGRESSION

## Segmentaion using the UNET and RecursiveUNet architecture

### Aim
This algorithm is intended to help diagnose and track any progression of Alzheimer's disease and formas of dimentia in patients displaying symptoms of disease including short and long term memory loss issues as well. This Quantification will help in disease management.

### System Design

UNET is an end to end AI system which features a Deep Neural Network algorithm that integrates into a clicinical-grade viewer and automatically measures hippocampal volumes of new patients as their studies are commited to clinical imaging archive.
